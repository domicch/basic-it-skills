# Social Media Safety

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp are wonderful ways to stay connected with family and friends. But they also come with privacy and security risks. This course will teach you how to use social media safely and protect your personal information.

## What is Social Media and Why Should You Care About Safety?

Social media platforms are websites and apps where you can share information, photos, and messages with your friends and the public. They're great for staying in touch, but they also collect a lot of personal information about you.

**Why safety matters:**
- Scammers use social media to steal money and personal information
- Your personal information (birthdate, address, phone number) can be misused
- Hackers can access your accounts and impersonate you
- Your photos and posts can be saved and shared without your permission

The good news: By learning a few simple practices, you can enjoy social media safely.

## Understanding Your Privacy Settings

Every social media platform has privacy settings that control who can see your information. These are your main defense against unwanted access.

### Facebook Privacy Settings

**To access privacy settings on Facebook:**
1. Click the down arrow in the top right corner
2. Select **Settings & Privacy** → **Settings**
3. Click **Privacy** on the left side

**Key settings to check:**

| Setting | Recommended | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Who can see your posts?** | Friends only | Prevents strangers from seeing your personal updates |
| **Who can contact you?** | Friends only | Stops unsolicited messages from strangers |
| **Who can see your friend list?** | Friends only | Prevents targeting based on your connections |
| **Who can see your email/phone?** | Friends only | Protects your contact information |
| **Limit past posts** | Friends only | Changes all your old posts to friends-only |

**Example:** If your posts are set to "Public," anyone on the internet can see your vacation photos, family updates, and daily activities. This gives scammers and burglars information about you.

## What to Share and What NOT to Share

The most important rule on social media: **If you wouldn't tell a stranger, don't post it.**

### SAFE to Share ✓
- Fun vacation photos (AFTER you return home)
- Hobbies and interests
- Celebratory moments (graduations, anniversaries)
- General updates about your day
- Compliments and encouragement for friends
- Memes and funny content

### NEVER Share ✗
- **Your full birthdate** — Used for identity theft
- **Your home address** — Invites burglars and stalkers
- **Your phone number** — Used for spam and scams
- **Your financial information** — Bank account, credit card numbers
- **Your Social Security Number** — The biggest identity theft risk
- **Passwords** — Never share these, even with "trusted" friends
- **Detailed vacation plans** — While you're away (wait until you're home)
- **Photos of your ID cards** — Driver's license, passport, etc.
- **Real-time location** — "I'm at the beach right now!" tells thieves your home is empty

### Real-World Example: The Vacation Robbery

Sarah posted: "Off to the beach for two weeks! Can't wait!" with photos showing she was leaving.

What happened:
- A stranger saw her post
- Found her location from her photos
- Realized her home would be empty for two weeks
- Later saw her home address in another post
- Her house was robbed

**Better approach:** Post beach photos AFTER you return home, without mentioning you were away.

## Common Social Media Scams

Scammers love social media because they can reach many people quickly. Here are the most common scams to watch for:

### 1. Romance Scams (Catfishing)

**How it works:**
- Someone creates a fake profile with a photo of an attractive person
- They send you friendly messages, and over weeks/months, they develop a "relationship" with you
- Eventually they ask for money: "I need $500 for plane tickets to visit you" or "I lost my wallet, can you send money?"

**Red flags:**
- They refuse video calls ("My camera is broken")
- They ask for money or gift cards
- Their story keeps changing
- They avoid meeting in person
- They ask for sensitive information

**Protection:**
- Video chat before developing a deep relationship
- Never send money to people you haven't met in person
- Be skeptical if someone falls in love with you very quickly
- If you're unsure, ask a trusted friend for a second opinion

### 2. Prize/Lottery Scams

**How it works:**
- You get a message: "Congratulations! You won a prize!" or "Claim your free gift card!"
- The message asks you to click a link or provide personal information
- You either get taken to a fake website (phishing) or infected with malware

**Red flags:**
- You never entered a contest
- You're asked to pay a "processing fee"
- They ask for personal information to claim the prize
- The link looks suspicious or is shortened (bit.ly, tinyurl)

**Protection:**
- You can't win a contest you didn't enter
- Legitimate companies never ask for payment to claim a prize
- Hover over links before clicking to see the real URL

### 3. "Can You Help Me?" Scams

**How it works:**
- Someone messages you: "Hi, it's me, I'm in trouble. Can you help?"
- Claims they're in a crisis (stuck abroad, accident, arrested) and need money ASAP
- Often impersonates a friend or family member

**What really happened:**
- The scammer hacked your friend's account, OR
- They created a fake profile that looks similar to your friend's

**Protection:**
- Call or message your friend directly (don't reply to the suspicious message)
- Real family emergencies can wait 5 minutes for a phone call
- No one should ask for money over social media if they really know you

### 4. Fake Job Offers

**How it works:**
- "Work from home! Make $500/week!"
- "You're hired! Send $50 for training materials"
- Often accompanied by poor grammar and spelling

**Red flags:**
- You didn't apply for the job
- They're offering too much money for minimal work
- They ask for payment upfront
- The company name is spelled slightly differently than the real company
- They ask for your banking information to "transfer your paycheck"

**Protection:**
- Apply directly through company websites, not social media
- Real jobs never ask for payment upfront
- Be suspicious of unsolicited job offers

## Recognizing Fake News and Misinformation

Social media spreads information (and misinformation) very quickly. Here's how to spot fake news:

**Red flags for fake news:**
- Sensational headline: "This ONE TRICK will Shock You!"
- No author or publication named
- Poor spelling and grammar
- Emotional language designed to make you angry
- Asks you to "share before they delete this!"
- No credible sources or links
- Information contradicts what reputable news sites report

**How to verify information:**
1. **Check the source** — Look for established news outlets (BBC, AP News, Reuters)
2. **Search for the story elsewhere** — If it's real, other news outlets will report it
3. **Check dates** — Old stories sometimes resurface as new
4. **Look for the original source** — Follow citations back to their source
5. **Ask yourself:** "Does this make sense? Is it possible?"
6. **Fact-check sites** — Visit Snopes.com, FactCheck.org, or PolitiFact for verification

**Example: A misleading post**

"URGENT: Hospitals are refusing to treat unvaccinated patients!!!"

Reality check:
- When you search, you find this is false
- Major news outlets haven't reported it
- A fact-checking site explains where this rumor started
- Emotional language and "URGENT" are designed to make you share without thinking

## Managing Friend Requests and Messages

### Who Should You Accept as a Friend?

**Safe to accept:**
- People you know in real life
- Friends of friends (if you recognize them)
- Family members
- People you've met at activities (church, clubs, class)

**Be cautious about:**
- Attractive strangers who message you immediately
- Profiles with no profile photo
- Profiles that are brand new (created this week)
- Profiles with very few friends

### Handling Unwanted Contact

**If someone is bothering you:**

1. **Block them:**
   - Facebook: Click their profile → click the three dots → "Block"
   - Instagram: On their profile → tap the three dots → "Block"

2. **Report them:**
   - Facebook/Instagram: Click "..." → "Report Account"
   - Choose the reason (harassment, misinformation, spam, etc.)

3. **Don't engage:**
   - Don't argue or insult them
   - Don't share your personal details
   - Don't click their links

## Protecting Your Photos and Personal Information

### Your Photos Are Permanent

**Important fact:** Once you post a photo, anyone can save it, even if you delete the original post.

**Best practices:**
- Don't post photos that contain:
  - Your address (house number visible)
  - Your car's license plate
  - Your personal documents
  - Intimate or embarrassing images

- **Photo metadata:** Your photos can contain location information (GPS coordinates)
  - Turn off "Location Services" for social media apps
  - Remove location tags before posting

**Protecting your image:**
- Use privacy settings to limit who can see your photos
- Review old photos occasionally and delete ones you don't want public
- Consider tagging settings: Choose who can tag you in photos

## Two-Factor Authentication: Extra Protection for Your Account

We covered this in the Password Security course, but it's especially important for social media.

**Two-factor authentication (2FA)** adds an extra security step when someone tries to log into your account.

### How to enable it:

**Facebook:**
1. Settings → Security and login
2. Scroll to "Two-factor authentication"
3. Click "Edit" → "Turn On"
4. Choose your method: SMS, authentication app, or security key

**Instagram:**
1. Settings → Accounts center → Security
2. Two-factor authentication → Turn on
3. Choose your method

**What it does:**
- Even if a hacker has your password, they can't log in
- You get a code on your phone to confirm login
- Takes 30 seconds, but stops most attacks

## Spotting Catfishing: How to Protect Yourself

Catfishing is when someone creates a fake profile to trick you into a romantic relationship. Here's how to spot it:

### Red Flags of Catfishing

| Sign | What It Means |
|------|--------------|
| **No video calls** | "My camera is broken" (3 months later?) is suspicious |
| **Vague personal details** | Their story keeps changing or doesn't add up |
| **Quick romantic moves** | "I love you" after 2 weeks of chatting |
| **Asks for money** | "I need $500 for airfare to visit you" |
| **Avoids meeting** | Always has an excuse why they can't video call |
| **Professional photos** | Their pictures look like stock photos (too perfect) |
| **Lives far away** | Always in another country, can't visit |

### How to Verify Someone Is Real

1. **Video call** — Ask for a video call (FaceTime, WhatsApp)
2. **Reverse image search** — Right-click their profile photo in Google Images. If it's stolen, you'll find it on other profiles
3. **Ask personal questions** — Ask about details they've mentioned; real people remember what they said
4. **Meet in public** — Before developing feelings, arrange a real-world meeting in a public place
5. **Trust your instincts** — If something feels off, it probably is

## Safe Messaging Practices

### Direct Messages (DMs) and Private Chat

**Safe practices:**
- Only accept DMs from people you know
- Be careful what you share in "private" messages—they're not truly private
- Screenshots can save messages forever
- Messages can be forwarded without your knowledge

**What NOT to share in messages:**
- Passwords or personal information
- Inappropriate photos
- Financial information
- Secrets you don't want public

### Group Chats

**Group chat safety:**
- Be aware: Everyone in the group can see what you write
- Be cautious who you invite to group chats
- Screenshot messages with sensitive information before sharing
- Don't assume something said "privately" in a group won't get out
