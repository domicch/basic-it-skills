## What is Malware?

**Malware** is short for "malicious software" — software designed to harm your computer or steal your information. Think of it like a disease — just as a virus can make you physically sick, computer viruses make your computer "sick" by slowing it down, damaging files, or stealing your data.

Malware is created by criminals who want to:
- **Steal your passwords and financial information**
- **Use your computer to attack other computers**
- **Display unwanted advertisements**
- **Encrypt your files and demand payment** (ransomware)
- **Spy on what you do online**
- **Sell your personal data**

---

## Types of Malware

There are several different types of malware. Each works differently:

### 1. Viruses

A **virus** is malware that replicates itself by copying to other files and programs.

- **How it spreads:** Through infected files, email attachments, or downloads
- **What it does:** Damages files, slows down your computer, or steals data
- **Example:** You download what looks like a photo, but it's actually a virus that damages your documents

**Key difference from other malware:** It needs to attach itself to another program to spread

### 2. Worms

A **worm** is malware that spreads itself without needing to attach to other files.

- **How it spreads:** Through networks, email, or internet connections — it copies itself automatically
- **What it does:** Consumes computer resources, slows everything down, spreads to other computers
- **Example:** It sends itself to all your email contacts automatically

### 3. Trojans (Trojan Horse)

A **Trojan** is malware disguised as something helpful or legitimate.

- **How it spreads:** You install it thinking it's a real program
- **What it does:** Once inside, it opens a "backdoor" for hackers to enter your computer
- **Example:** You download what looks like a free game, but it's actually malware that gives hackers access to your computer

### 4. Ransomware

**Ransomware** encrypts (locks) your files so you can't access them, then demands payment to unlock them.

- **How it spreads:** Through infected email attachments, malicious websites, or exploiting security vulnerabilities
- **What it does:** Locks all your important files and displays a message: "Pay $500 to get your files back"
- **Why it's dangerous:** You could lose all your photos, documents, and personal files forever

```
Normal File:
[photo.jpg] → You can open it, view it, edit it ✓

After Ransomware:
[photo.jpg] → Encrypted and locked ✗
"PAY $500 TO UNLOCK YOUR FILES"
```

### 5. Spyware

**Spyware** secretly watches what you do on your computer.

- **How it spreads:** Often bundled with free software downloads
- **What it does:** Records your keystrokes, takes screenshots, monitors websites you visit, steals passwords
- **Why it's dangerous:** Criminals can see everything you type, including passwords and credit card numbers
- **You might not even know it's there**

### 6. Adware

**Adware** displays unwanted advertisements on your computer.

- **How it spreads:** Through free software, games, or browser extensions
- **What it does:** Shows pop-up ads constantly, redirects you to ad websites, slows down your computer
- **Example:** You download what looks like a free screen saver, and suddenly your screen is flooded with ads

## How Does Malware Get on Your Computer?

Malware doesn't just appear — it gets there through specific methods. Understanding these helps you prevent it.

### Method 1: Downloading Infected Files

```
You think you're downloading:    But you're actually getting:
[Free Game] ────→ Download      [Free Game] + [Malware]
[Screen Saver]                  [Screen Saver] + [Spyware]
[Movie]                         [Movie] + [Ransomware]

Result: Computer is infected!
```

**How to avoid it:**
- Only download from official websites or app stores
- Be suspicious of "free" software from unknown sources
- Check if the file size seems reasonable (a game shouldn't be 2MB if normal games are 500MB)

### Method 2: Email Attachments

An email arrives with an attachment. It looks legitimate, so you open it. Inside is malware.

```
Email arrives:
────────────────────────────────
From: your.bank@security.com
Subject: Verify Your Account
Attachment: [Invoice.exe]  ← DANGEROUS!
────────────────────────────────

You open the attachment thinking it's an invoice.
         ↓
MALWARE INSTALLED!
```

**How to avoid it:**
- ❌ Don't open attachments from unknown senders
- ❌ Don't open attachments that end in `.exe`, `.bat`, `.scr`, `.zip` unless you're absolutely sure
- ✅ Contact the sender directly by phone to ask if they sent an attachment
- ✅ Scan suspicious attachments with antivirus before opening

### Method 3: Malicious Websites

You visit a website and just by being there, malware is downloaded without your permission.

**This is called "Drive-by Download"**

```
You visit a website:
[You type website.com]
         ↓
[Website loads]
         ↓
Website has hidden malware code
         ↓
Malware downloads without asking
         ↓
Your computer is infected!
```

**How to avoid it:**
- Only visit trusted websites
- Watch for warnings in your browser (red warning page)
- Keep your browser updated
- Don't click on suspicious ads or pop-ups

### Method 4: Fake Software Updates

A pop-up appears: "Your software needs updating! Click here to update."

But it's not a real update — it's malware disguised as one.

```
Pop-up appears:
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Your software is       │
│ outdated! Update now?  │
│ [YES] [NO]             │
└────────────────────────┘

You click YES
         ↓
Instead of updating, malware installs!
```

**How to avoid it:**
- ✅ Go directly to the official website for updates
- ✅ Use your computer's built-in update feature
- ❌ Don't click on pop-up alerts

### Method 5: USB Drives and External Storage

You plug in a USB drive from someone else, and malware on that drive infects your computer.

**How to avoid it:**
- Don't plug in USB drives from untrusted sources
- Scan external drives with antivirus before opening files
- Use read-only mode if available

## How to Prevent Malware

Prevention is much easier than dealing with an infection. Here's how to protect yourself:

### 1. Use Antivirus Software

**Antivirus software** is your first defense. It scans your computer constantly for malware.

```
Antivirus Software

[Your Computer]
       ↓
[ANTIVIRUS GUARD]  ← Watches constantly
       ↓
Every file, download, email attachment
passes through the antivirus
       ↓
If it detects malware:
"STOP! This is dangerous!"
[Malware blocked]
```

**What you should do:**
- ✅ Use a reputable antivirus program (Bitdefender, Norton, Kaspersky, Avast, Windows Defender)
- ✅ Keep it updated — new malware appears every day
- ✅ Run full scans at least once a month
- ✅ Enable real-time protection (watches all the time)

**Built-in Options (Windows and Mac):**
- **Windows:** Windows Defender (built-in, free, good protection)
- **Mac:** macOS has built-in protection, but you can add more

### 2. Keep Your Operating System Updated

Your operating system (Windows, macOS, etc.) regularly releases security updates.

These updates fix security holes that malware could exploit.

```
Without Updates:          With Updates:
[Computer]               [Computer]
   ↓                        ↓
[Security hole] ← ─ ─ ─ [Patched hole]
   ↓                        ↓
Malware enters           Malware blocked
```

**What you should do:**
- ✅ Turn on automatic updates
- ✅ Install updates as soon as they're available
- ✅ Restart your computer when prompted after an update

### 3. Keep Your Browser Updated

Your web browser needs updates to fix security problems.

- **Chrome:** Updates automatically
- **Safari:** Updates with macOS
- **Firefox:** Check periodically or set to auto-update
- **Edge:** Updates automatically

### 4. Be Careful With Downloads

```
Safe Downloads:              Risky Downloads:
✅ Official websites          ❌ Unknown sites
✅ App stores                 ❌ File sharing sites
✅ Known sources              ❌ Torrent sites
                             ❌ "Free" software from random sites
```

### 5. Use Strong Passwords

If your account is hacked, malware can:
- Install itself on all your devices
- Send itself to all your contacts
- Access your files and photos

✅ Use unique, strong passwords for each account (see Password Security course)

### 6. Don't Fall for Social Engineering

Criminals trick you into installing malware by:
- Creating urgent messages ("Act now!")
- Pretending to be from trusted companies
- Offering free gifts or money

**How to avoid it:**
- ❌ Don't click links in suspicious emails
- ❌ Don't open attachments from unknown senders
- ✅ When in doubt, contact the company directly by phone

### 7. Disable Unnecessary Browser Extensions

Browser extensions are add-ons that change how your browser works.

Some extensions are malware or contain spyware.

**How to check:**
- **Chrome:** Settings → Extensions → Review all extensions
- **Firefox:** Add-ons → Review installed add-ons
- **Safari:** Preferences → Extensions

**Remove extensions you don't recognize or use.**

### 8. Use a Firewall

A **firewall** is like a security guard for your network.

It blocks unauthorized access from the internet.

```
Internet ←→ [FIREWALL] ←→ Your Computer

Firewall asks:
"Is this allowed?"
Yes → Let it through
No → Block it
```

**Most computers have a built-in firewall:**
- **Windows Defender Firewall** (Windows)
- **macOS firewall** (built-in)

**Keep it turned on.**

## What to Do If You Get Malware

If you suspect your computer has malware, act quickly:

### Step 1: Disconnect From the Internet

```
[Infected Computer]
         ↓
Disconnect from WiFi or unplug ethernet cable
         ↓
Malware can't:
- Send your data to criminals
- Download more malware
- Spread to other devices
```

**Why:** Prevents the malware from sending stolen data or downloading more malware.

### Step 2: Run Antivirus Scans

1. Open your antivirus program
2. Run a "Full Scan" or "Complete Scan"
3. This takes 30 minutes to 2 hours
4. Let it finish completely
5. Follow its recommendations (usually "Remove" or "Quarantine")

**Important:** Some malware is hard to remove. You might need to run multiple scans.

### Step 3: Try These Removal Tools

If your regular antivirus doesn't catch everything, try these specialized tools:

**Malwarebytes** (free version available)
- Excellent at catching what other programs miss
- Download from malwarebytes.com
- Run a full scan

**Windows Defender Offline Scan** (Windows only)
- Scans before Windows fully loads (catches more malware)
- Settings → Update & Security → Windows Defender → "Scan offline"

### Step 4: Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

1. Go to your browser settings
2. Find Extensions or Add-ons
3. Remove anything you don't recognize
4. Reset your home page and search engine to your preferred choices

### Step 5: Change Your Passwords

If malware was on your computer, criminals might have seen your passwords.

**Change passwords for:**
- Email
- Banking
- Social media
- Important accounts

**Do this from a clean device if possible** (not the infected computer).

### Step 6: Monitor Your Accounts

Watch for suspicious activity:
- ✅ Check your bank statements
- ✅ Review credit card transactions
- ✅ Look for unauthorized purchases
- ✅ Check your email for password reset attempts
- ✅ Monitor your credit report

If you see suspicious activity, contact your bank immediately.

### Step 7: Consider Professional Help

If the malware won't go away:
- Take your computer to a professional repair shop
- They have specialized tools and expertise
- Be prepared to pay for this service ($100-$300 typically)
