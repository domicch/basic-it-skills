# Mobile Phone Security

Your smartphone or tablet is a pocket-sized computer that contains some of your most sensitive information: photos, messages, banking apps, email, and more. This course will teach you how to keep your phone secure and protect your privacy.

## Why Mobile Phone Security Matters

Your phone is more valuable to a thief than just its hardware cost. It contains:
- Access to your email and social media accounts
- Banking and payment information
- Personal photos and messages
- Location data
- Health and fitness information
- Contact information for everyone you know

If a thief gets your phone, they can:
- Drain your bank account
- Impersonate you to friends and family
- Access private photos
- Steal your identity
- Lock you out of your own accounts

The good news: A few simple security practices will protect you.

## Physical Security: Protecting Your Device

### Keep Your Phone With You

**Common theft scenarios:**
- Left on a coffee shop table
- Forgotten in a taxi or Uber
- Stolen from a gym locker
- Left unattended on a beach
- Taken from a purse or pocket

**Best practice:** Keep your phone with you at all times. If you must set it down:
- Put it in your pocket or purse
- Keep your bag in sight
- Don't leave it on a table while distracted
- Use a phone strap or cross-body bag

### Be Aware of Your Surroundings

When using your phone in public:
- Be aware of people around you
- Don't use your phone while walking alone at night
- Avoid using it on public transportation with strangers nearby
- Cover the screen if you're viewing sensitive information

### Physical Damage and Water

**Protect your phone from:**
- Dropping it (get a case and screen protector)
- Water damage (use a waterproof case near water)
- Extreme heat or cold (don't leave in hot cars)
- Pressure or bending (don't sit on it)

## Device Passcodes and Biometric Security

### Using a Strong Passcode

Your passcode is the first line of defense against anyone with physical access to your phone.

**iPhone:**
1. Settings → Face ID & Passcode (or Touch ID & Passcode)
2. Tap "Change Passcode"
3. Create a 6-digit or longer passcode
4. Write it down and store it somewhere safe (not your phone)

**Android:**
1. Settings → Security (or Lock screen)
2. Select "Passcode" or "PIN"
3. Create a 6-digit or longer code
4. Write it down and store it somewhere safe

**Good passcodes:**
- ✓ 6+ digits or characters
- ✓ Not your birthday, phone number, or address
- ✓ Not a simple pattern (1-2-3-4 or 1-1-1-1)
- ✓ Mixed numbers and letters (if your phone allows)

**Bad passcodes:**
- ✗ Your birthdate (123456 or 06161960)
- ✗ Your address
- ✗ Sequential numbers (123456 or 654321)
- ✗ Repeated digits (111111 or 999999)
- ✗ Phone number or Social Security Number

**Do NOT share your passcode**, even with family members. If someone needs access to your phone:
- Unlock it first, then hand it to them
- Don't tell them the passcode

### Biometric Security: Fingerprint and Face Recognition

Modern phones use your fingerprint or face instead of (or in addition to) a passcode.

**iPhone Face ID:**
- Uses facial recognition to unlock
- More secure than a passcode
- Can't be forced to unlock against your will (unlike passcode)
- Set up: Settings → Face ID & Passcode → Set Up Face ID
- Tip: Add an alternate appearance (if you wear glasses or change makeup)

**iPhone Touch ID:**
- Uses your fingerprint
- Quick and convenient
- Set up: Settings → Touch ID & Passcode → Add a Fingerprint
- Add multiple fingers (thumb, index finger) for convenience

**Android Fingerprint:**
- Most Android phones have fingerprint sensors
- Set up: Settings → Security → Fingerprint → Add Fingerprint
- Add multiple fingers for convenience

**Android Face Unlock:**
- Uses facial recognition
- Available on newer Android phones
- Less secure than fingerprint, but convenient

**Important:** Even with biometric security, set a passcode too. If your phone can't recognize your face/fingerprint, you need the passcode to unlock it.

## Device Lock Settings

### Screen Lock Timeout

Your phone should automatically lock when you're not using it.

**iPhone:**
1. Settings → Display & Brightness → Auto-Lock
2. Choose: 1 minute (most secure) or 5 minutes (convenient)
3. Recommendation: 1 minute for security

**Android:**
1. Settings → Display → Screen timeout (or Lock screen)
2. Choose: 1 minute (most secure) or 5 minutes (convenient)
3. Recommendation: 1 minute for security

**Why this matters:** If you set your phone down and forget it, it will lock automatically. Someone can't pick it up and access your apps while unlocked.

### Notifications on Lock Screen

Your lock screen can show notifications (messages, emails, etc.) even when your phone is locked.

**iPhone:**
1. Settings → Notifications → Show Previews
2. Choose "Always" (shows everything), "When Unlocked" (most private), or "Never" (you miss info)
3. Recommendation: "When Unlocked" for privacy

**Android:**
1. Settings → Apps & notifications → Notifications
2. Look for "On Lock screen" or "Lock screen notifications"
3. Choose to hide sensitive content on the lock screen

**Why this matters:** If someone picks up your locked phone, they'll see your messages and notifications. Setting previews to "When Unlocked" prevents this.

## App Security and Permissions

### Installing Apps Safely

**Only install apps from:**
- Official app stores: Apple App Store or Google Play Store
- Never from unknown websites or links in emails

**Why official stores matter:**
- Apps are reviewed before being available
- Apps with malware are usually removed
- You can report bad apps and read reviews

**Check app reviews before installing:**
- Read the most recent reviews (not just 5-star reviews)
- Look for complaints about charges, crashes, or sketchy behavior
- Check how many times it's been downloaded
- See if it's from a company you recognize

### App Permissions

Apps ask for permission to access your information:
- Camera and microphone
- Location
- Contacts
- Photos and files
- Calendar and reminders
- Health data

**Only grant necessary permissions:**

| App | Should Have Permission | Permission |
|-----|------------------------|-----------|
| **Camera app** | ✓ Yes | Camera |
| **Email app** | ✓ Yes | Contacts, Email |
| **Maps** | ✓ Yes | Location |
| **Social media** | Maybe | Location, Camera, Contacts |
| **Game** | ✗ No | Contacts, Camera, or Location |
| **Flashlight** | ✗ No | Camera |

**iPhone permission review:**
1. Settings → Privacy
2. Tap each category (Camera, Microphone, Location, etc.)
3. Check which apps have permission
4. Turn off apps that don't need the permission

**Android permission review:**
1. Settings → Apps → App Permissions (or Permissions)
2. Review Camera, Microphone, Location, etc.
3. Remove permissions apps don't need

**Red flags:**
- A game asking for access to your contacts
- A flashlight app asking for your location
- A calculator asking for camera access

- LastPass (free version available)

**Benefits:**
- You don't have to remember passwords
- You can use different passwords for every account
- Passwords are encrypted and secure

### Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Enable 2FA on your most important accounts: email, banking, and social media.

**On your phone:**
1. Go to the account settings (email, Facebook, Google, etc.)
2. Find "Security" or "Account Settings"
3. Enable "Two-factor authentication"
4. Choose to receive codes by text message or use an authenticator app

**Authenticator apps are more secure:**
- Authy
- Google Authenticator
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Work even if you lose cell service

## Public Wi-Fi and Network Security

### Using Wi-Fi Safely

Public Wi-Fi at coffee shops, libraries, and airports is convenient but risky.

**Risks of public Wi-Fi:**
- Hackers can see your data if it's not encrypted
- Fake Wi-Fi networks impersonating real ones
- Malware spread through shared networks
- Your location can be tracked

### Safe Public Wi-Fi Practices

**Before connecting:**
1. Ask the business for the correct Wi-Fi name (don't assume)
2. Check for typos ("StarBucks" instead of "Starbucks" is fake)
3. Avoid connecting to unknown networks

**While using public Wi-Fi:**
- Don't log into banking or email apps
- Don't enter passwords or credit card information
- Don't access sensitive documents
- Don't make purchases

**Safe public Wi-Fi activities:**
- Browsing public websites
- Checking news
- Reading email previews
- Using social media (already public)

### Using a VPN for Public Wi-Fi

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your data so hackers can't see it.

**Free VPNs:**
- ProtonVPN (good privacy)
- Hotspot Shield (fast)
- Windscribe (good features)

**Paid VPNs (more reliable):**
- NordVPN
- ExpressVPN
- Surfshark

**How to use a VPN:**
1. Download a VPN app from your app store
2. Create an account
3. Open the app and tap "Connect"
4. You'll see a VPN icon at the top of your screen
5. Now your data is encrypted on public Wi-Fi

**Recommendation:** Use a VPN anytime you're on public Wi-Fi, especially for banking or email.

## Location Services and Privacy

### Control Location Sharing

Your phone tracks your location using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data. This is useful for maps, but can be a privacy risk.

**iPhone location settings:**
1. Settings → Privacy → Location Services
2. Toggle "Location Services" on or off
3. Review each app below and choose "Never," "While Using," or "Always"
4. Recommendation: Choose "While Using" for most apps

**Android location settings:**
1. Settings → Location
2. Toggle "Location" on or off
3. Tap "App permissions" to review which apps have access
4. Recommendation: Choose "Allow only while using the app"

**Sensitive location concerns:**
- Don't let apps track your home location
- Turn off location sharing for dating apps
- Be careful with fitness apps (they show your running routes)
- Social media apps don't need constant location access

### Share My Location and Family Sharing

**iPhone Family Sharing:**
1. Settings → [Your Name] → Family Sharing
2. Add family members
3. Share your location with family

**Android Family Link:**
- Set up parental controls
- Share location with family members
- Monitor children's device usage

**Important:** Only share location with family members you trust completely.

- Cheap knockoff of an expensive app
- Lots of bad reviews
- Developer is unknown

**Protection:**
- Only download from official developers
- Check reviews before installing
- Look for blue verification checkmark
- If in doubt, use the website instead of an app

### Fake Customer Service Calls and Texts

**How it works:**

- They ask you to verify: password, account number, Social Security Number
- They have your information and drain your account

**Remember:** No legitimate company will ask for passwords over the phone or text.

**Protection:**
- Hang up and call the official number (on your statement)
- Don't give information to unsolicited callers
- Banks already have your account number
