## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a type of fraud where criminals send fake emails that appear to come from trusted companies or people to trick you into:
- **Giving them your passwords** - To access your bank account, email, or social media
- **Revealing personal information** - Social security numbers, credit card numbers, birthdates
- **Clicking malicious links** - Which lead to fake websites designed to steal your information
- **Downloading harmful attachments** - Files that contain viruses or spyware
- **Transferring money** - By tricking you into believing you're helping someone in need

Phishing is one of the most common ways criminals steal money and personal information. Learning to spot phishing emails can protect you and your family.

## How to Spot a Phishing Email - Complete Guide

### 1. Check the Sender's Email Address (Most Important!)

The sender's email address is usually the biggest clue. Real companies use their official domain names.

#### What to Look For:

**Legitimate Examples:**
- Amazon: `service@amazon.com` (ends with @amazon.com)
- Bank of America: `alerts@bankofamerica.com` (ends with @bankofamerica.com)
- Apple: `id@apple.com` (ends with @apple.com)

**Phishing Examples (Red Flags):**
- `service@amazon-security.com` ❌ (Not @amazon.com)
- `alerts@bankofamerica-verify.com` ❌ (Not @bankofamerica.com)
- `support@app1e.com` ❌ (Notice the "1" instead of "l" in apple)
- `noreply@amazon.support.com` ❌ (Support is not part of Amazon's domain)
- `no-reply.amazon@mail.com` ❌ (Amazon is in the middle, not the domain)

#### Rule of Thumb:
**The domain must be exactly the company's official domain** — such as `@amazon.com`, `@amazon.co.uk` (Amazon UK), or `@amazon.com.au` (Amazon Australia). Watch out for anything extra added before or after, like `amazon-security.com` or `amazon.support.com`.

### 2. Verify Hyperlinks Before Clicking

Criminals often hide fake links behind real-looking text. Always check where a link actually goes before clicking.

#### How to Check a Link (On Desktop/Laptop):

**Method 1: Hover Over the Link**
1. Move your mouse over any blue link in the email (don't click!)
2. Look at the bottom left corner of your browser window
3. A tooltip will show the actual URL

**Example:**
- Email shows: "Click here to verify your account"
- Actual link: `http://verify-amazon-security.com` ❌ (Not Amazon's real domain!)

**Method 2: Check the Domain Name**
The domain name is the main website address after `https://` or `http://`

Legitimate:
- `https://www.amazon.com/...` ✅
- `https://mybank.com/login` ✅
- `https://accounts.google.com/...` ✅

Suspicious:
- `https://amazon-verify.com/...` ❌
- `https://verify.amazon.net/...` ❌ (Not .com)
- `https://bankofa merica.com/...` ❌ (Spaces or odd characters)
- `https://amaz0n.com/...` ❌ (Zero instead of letter O)

#### How to Check a Link (On Mobile):

On phones and tablets, you can't always see the full URL by hovering. Instead:

1. **Press and hold** the link for 2-3 seconds (don't tap it)
2. A popup will appear showing the real URL
3. Check if the domain matches the company
4. If something looks wrong, tap "Cancel" or "Close"

**Example for iPhone:**
- Press and hold the link → "Open Link" appears at the top
- Look at the URL shown - if it's not Apple's official domain, cancel

**Example for Android:**
- Long press the link → "Copy link" or "Open in new tab"
- Open the link in a new tab and check the address bar

### 3. Look for These Red Flags

#### A. Urgent or Threatening Language
Phishing emails create fear to make you act quickly without thinking.

**Phishing Examples:**
- "Your account has been compromised! Click here immediately!"
- "Verify your information within 24 hours or your account will be closed!"
- "Suspicious activity detected! Confirm your identity now!"
- "Action required immediately to protect your account"
- "Your payment method failed. Update it now to avoid service interruption"

**Real companies:**
- Usually give you time to respond
- Explain the situation clearly
- Don't use aggressive language
- Don't demand immediate action

#### B. Requests for Passwords or Sensitive Information

**This is a MAJOR RED FLAG:**
- Banks will NEVER ask for your password via email
- PayPal will NEVER ask for your password via email
- Email services will NEVER ask for your password via email
- Real companies will NEVER ask for your full credit card number via email

**Phishing Examples:**
- "Please reply to this email with your password to verify your account"
- "Click the link and enter your username and password"
- "Confirm your account by providing your credit card number"
- "Enter your Social Security Number to verify your identity"

#### C. Generic Greetings (Not Your Name)

**Phishing:**
- "Dear Customer,"
- "Dear User,"
- "Dear Account Holder,"
- "Hello there,"

**Legitimate (Usually):**
- "Dear John," (uses your actual name)
- "Hi Sarah," (personalized)

Why? Real companies usually have your name in their database.

#### D. Poor Grammar, Spelling, or Formatting

Professional companies proofread their emails. Lots of errors = big red flag.

**Phishing Examples:**
- "We need to verify you're informations" (wrong: "informations")
- "Update you're account now" (wrong: "your")
- "Pls clik hear to confirm account" (too casual, bad spelling)
- Inconsistent formatting, odd fonts, or strange layouts
- "Your Acc0unt has been l0cked" (number 0 instead of letter O)

#### E. Suspicious Attachments

**Never open attachments from:**
- Unknown senders
- Unexpected attachments (even if from someone you know)
- Files with these extensions: `.exe`, `.scr`, `.bat`, `.zip`, `.rar`

**Warning signs:**
- "Important document" with no context
- "Invoice" you didn't request
- "Package delivery" notification with an attachment
- File name with double extensions like `document.pdf.exe` (dangerous!)

#### F. Unusual Payment or Information Requests

Real companies don't ask for these via email:
- "Send us iTunes gift cards to pay your bill"
- "Transfer money to confirm your account"
- "Wire $500 to verify your identity"
- "Buy Google Play cards to unlock your account"

These are classic scam requests!

#### G. Mismatched or Suspicious Sender Names

**Phishing Examples:**
- From: "Apple Security" but email is `security@notapple.com`
- From: "Bank of America" but sender address is `bankofamerica@gmail.com`
- From: "Amazon Support" but email is `support@amaz0n.net` (fake domain)

## Real-World Phishing Examples

### Example 1: Fake Bank Email

```
From: alerts@bankverification-secure.com
Subject: URGENT: Your Account Has Been Locked

Dear Valued Customer,

We have detected unauthorized activity on your account.
To protect your account, please verify your information immediately.

Click here to verify your account

This is very important!

Bank Security Team
```

**Why this is a scam:**
- ❌ Sender email is `bankverification-secure.com` (not the bank's real domain)
- ❌ Generic "Dear Valued Customer" (no personal name)
- ❌ Urgent language ("URGENT", "immediately")
- ❌ Asking you to click to verify (real banks don't do this)
- ❌ Link probably goes to a fake website that looks like the real bank

**What to do:**
1. Don't click the link
2. Go to your bank's website directly (type the address in your browser)
3. Log in to check if there's actually any problem
4. Call your bank using the number on your card
5. Delete the email

### Example 2: Fake Apple ID Email

```
From: id@apple-security.com
Subject: Verify your Apple ID

Your Apple ID has been used to sign in from a new device.

Please verify your Apple ID and password here: [link]

If this wasn't you, secure your account now.

Apple Support Team
```

**Why this is a scam:**
- ❌ Email is from `apple-security.com` (not @apple.com)
- ❌ Asking for Apple ID and password (Apple never does this)
- ❌ Vague threat ("If this wasn't you")
- ❌ Link probably leads to a fake login page

**The fake page might look exactly like Apple's real login page, but check the URL in the address bar!**

**What to do:**
1. Don't enter your password on that page
2. Go to apple.com directly in your browser
3. Log in to your account from the real website
4. Check "Security" or "Account" settings for any suspicious activity

---

### Example 3: Fake PayPal Email

```
From: service@paypal-security.net
Subject: Confirm your payment method

Your payment method is about to expire. Update it now to avoid service interruption.

Update Payment Method: [link]

Thank you,
PayPal Security Team
```

**Why this is a scam:**
- ❌ Sender is `paypal-security.net` (not @paypal.com)
- ❌ Threatening language about payment expiring
- ❌ Asking you to click a link to update payment (dangerous!)
- ❌ PayPal usually lets you update payment info in your account settings, not via email links

**What to do:**
1. Don't click the link
2. Log in to PayPal directly through paypal.com
3. Go to your wallet or payment methods section
4. Update payment info there if needed

---

### Example 4: Fake Package Delivery Email

```
From: delivery@fedex-delivery.com
Subject: Your package delivery - Action required

We attempted to deliver your package but could not find your address.

Click here to confirm delivery: [link with attachment]

Click the attachment to reschedule: package_info.exe

Thank you,
FedEx Delivery Service
```

**Why this is a scam:**
- ❌ Email from `fedex-delivery.com` (not @fedex.com)
- ❌ Attachment with `.exe` extension (executable file = virus risk!)
- ❌ You didn't order anything or the attachment name is suspicious
- ❌ Real delivery companies don't ask you to download files

**What to do:**
1. Don't download the attachment
2. Don't click the link
3. Go to fedex.com or ups.com directly
4. Search for your tracking number there
5. If you didn't order anything, it's definitely a scam
