## What is Phishing?

Phishing is when criminals send fake emails that look like they're from legitimate companies to trick you into:
- Giving them your password or personal information
- Clicking malicious links
- Downloading harmful attachments

## How to Spot a Phishing Email

### Red Flags:
- **Sender's email address looks suspicious** - Not the official company domain
- **Urgent language** - "Act now!" "Verify immediately!" "Account will be closed!"
- **Requests for passwords** - Real companies never ask for passwords via email
- **Generic greetings** - "Dear Customer" instead of your name
- **Suspicious links** - Hover over links to see the real URL (often mismatched)
- **Poor grammar/spelling** - Professional companies proofread
- **Unusual requests** - Ask for wire transfer, gift cards, or unusual payment

## What NOT to Do:
- ❌ Don't click links in suspicious emails
- ❌ Don't download attachments from unknown senders
- ❌ Don't reply with personal information
- ❌ Don't call phone numbers in the email

## What TO Do:
- ✅ Contact the company directly using a number from their official website
- ✅ Report the phishing email to the company
- ✅ Delete the email
- ✅ If you already clicked, change your password immediately
- ✅ Check your accounts for unauthorized activity

## Example Phishing Email

**Subject:** "URGENT: Confirm Your Banking Details"

This is a classic phishing attempt because:
- Uses urgent language
- Requests sensitive information
- Email address isn't from the real bank domain

## Practice Tip

When in doubt, go to the company's official website directly and log in there instead of clicking email links. This is the safest way to access your accounts.
