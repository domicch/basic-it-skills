## Part 1: Strangers Online (Catfishing & Predators)

### Why Some People Pretend to Be Someone They're Not

On the internet, nobody knows who you really are. Some bad people use this to trick kids.

**What they do:**
- Pretend to be kids your age
- Pretend to be famous people
- Pretend to like the same things you like
- Try to become your friend
- Ask you personal questions
- Eventually ask you to send photos or meet them in person

This is called **catfishing** — when someone pretends to be someone else to trick you.

### Red Flags: How to Spot a Fake Stranger

**Warning sign #1: They ask personal questions**

Examples:
- "What's your real name?"
- "What school do you go to?"
- "What's your address?"
- "What's your phone number?"
- "Do your parents know you're online?"
- "Can we talk on WhatsApp instead?"

**Real friends don't ask these things. If someone asks, they're suspicious.**

**Warning sign #2: Their story doesn't add up**

Examples:
- They say they're 11 years old but use complicated adult words
- They say they live in your city but don't know any landmarks
- They say they go to your school but can't name any teachers
- They say they like the same interests but don't know details

**If someone's story seems wrong, trust your instincts. They might be fake.**

**Warning sign #3: They want to move to private chat**

Examples:
- "Let's chat on WhatsApp instead of here"
- "Can you add me to WhatsApp? My parents monitor this"
- "Let's move this conversation somewhere private"

**Why they do this:** So nobody can see what they're saying. That's a huge red flag.

**Warning sign #4: They ask for photos**

Examples:
- "Send me a selfie"
- "Can I see what you look like?"
- "Send a photo of you"
- "Send a video call"

**NEVER do this. Ever. Even if they seem nice.**

**Warning sign #5: They ask to meet you**

Examples:
- "Let's meet up at the park"
- "Can I come to your house?"
- "Let's meet after school"

**NEVER agree to this. Ever.**

### Real Examples From YouTube, WhatsApp, and Websites

**Example 1: YouTube Stranger**

You post a comment on a YouTube video: "Cool video! I like gaming too."

A stranger replies: "Hey! I like gaming too! I'm 11 like you. Want to be friends? Add me on WhatsApp."

They send you their phone number.

**Red flags:**
- ✗ They responded to your comment very quickly
- ✗ They claim to be your age
- ✗ They immediately want to move to WhatsApp
- ✗ They want your phone number

**What to do:** Don't respond. Block them. Tell an adult.

**Example 2: WhatsApp from Unknown Number**

You get a WhatsApp message from a number you don't recognize:

"Hi! I'm Sophia, 11 years old. A friend showed me your YouTube comment and I thought you seemed cool. Do you want to be friends? What's your real name? What school do you go to?"

**Red flags:**
- ✗ Unknown number
- ✗ Claims to be your age
- ✗ Asking for your real name
- ✗ Asking what school you go to

**Red flags:**
- ✗ Random website asking personal questions
- ✗ Being too friendly too quickly
- ✗ Asking for identifying information

**What to do:** Close the chat. Don't answer. Tell an adult.

**Example 4: YouTube Comment Pretending to Be a Friend**

You comment on a YouTube video: "This is awesome! I learned so much!"

Someone replies: "Hey! I'm Marcus from your class! I didn't know you watched this. Add me on WhatsApp!"

But you don't know anyone named Marcus at school.

**Red flags:**
- ✗ Pretending to know you
- ✗ Claiming to be from your school
- ✗ Wanting to move to WhatsApp
- ✗ You've never heard of them

**What to do:** Don't reply. Block them. Tell an adult.

**Example 5: The "Free Gift Card" Scammer**

Someone messages you on WhatsApp: "Congratulations! You won a free $50 gift card! Just send me a photo of yourself and your address so I can send it to you!"

**Red flags:**
- ✗ You never entered a contest
- ✗ Asking for a photo
- ✗ Asking for your address
- ✗ Something you didn't win

**What to do:** Don't respond. Block them. Tell an adult.

- Adults know how to handle this

**Step 4: Report them**
- Report the account to YouTube, WhatsApp, or the website
- This helps protect other kids

## Part 2: Fake Websites & Scams

### What is a Fake Website?

A fake website is designed to trick you. It might:
- Look like a real website but have a slightly different address
- Steal your information
- Give your computer a virus
- Take you to a scam page
- Download malware onto your device

**Scammers make fake websites because they want:**
- Your personal information
- Your parents' credit card information
- To infect your computer with a virus
- To trick you into downloading something dangerous

### How to Spot a Fake Website

**Red Flag #1: The Address (URL) is Wrong**

The address bar shows the website's real name.

**Safe addresses:**
- `https://www.youtube.com` ✓
- `https://www.google.com` ✓
- `https://www.wikipedia.org` ✓

**Fake addresses (watch for these):**
- `https://www.youltube.com` ❌ (typo: "youltube" instead of "youtube")
- `https://www.ytube.com` ❌ (missing letters)
- `https://youtube.secure-login.com` ❌ (extra words added)
- `https://www.youtube.com-verify.net` ❌ (sneaky misspelling)
- `https://youtubedownload.site` ❌ (wrong domain)

**How to check:**
1. Look at the address bar at the top
2. Read it carefully — letter by letter
3. If it's even slightly different, it's FAKE

**Red Flag #2: No "https" or Padlock Icon**

Every safe website has:
- `https` at the beginning (not just `http`)
- A padlock icon 🔒 next to the address

If you don't see these, the website is NOT SAFE.

**Red Flag #3: Poor Spelling and Grammar**

Real websites are made by companies that check their work.

Fake websites often have:
- Misspelled words
- Bad grammar
- Weird sentences

**Example of fake text:**
"Congrats! You are the lucky winner! Click here for claim you prize!!!"

(Notice: "claim you prize" should be "claim your prize")

**Real text:**
"Congratulations! You won the drawing. Click here to claim your prize."

**Red Flag #4: Offers That Are Too Good to Be True**

**Fake offers:**
- "FREE iPhone! Click here!"
- "You won $10,000 instantly!"
- "Unlimited free movie downloads!"
- "Free gift card — no purchase needed!"
- "You were selected as our 1,000th visitor!"

**The truth:** Real companies don't give away expensive things for free. If it sounds too good to be true, it IS too good to be true.

**Red Flag #5: Asking for Personal Information**

**Fake websites might ask:**
- "Enter your parents' credit card number"
- "What's your real name and address?"
- "What's your school name?"
- "Confirm your phone number"

**Real websites don't ask for:**
- Your address (just for shipping)
- Your parents' credit card (unless buying something)
- Your school name
- Your phone number (unless necessary)

### Real Examples of Fake Websites

**Example 1: Fake YouTube Download Site**

You watch a YouTube video and see a comment: "Download this video for free here! [link]"

You click the link. The website looks kind of like YouTube, but:
- The address is `www.youtubedownload.xyz` (NOT youtube.com)
- There's no padlock icon
- It says "Download Now!" in big red letters
- It asks for your parents' credit card number

**Red flags:**
- ✗ Wrong address
- ✗ No padlock
- ✗ Asking for credit card
- ✗ Looks similar but different

**What to do:** Leave immediately. Don't download anything. Tell an adult.

**Example 2: Fake "You Won a Prize!" Website**

A popup appears while you're browsing: "CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE OUR 1,000TH VISITOR! YOU WON AN iPAD! CLICK HERE!"

You click it. The website asks:
- "What's your full name?"
- "What's your address?"
- "What's your parents' email?"

**Red flags:**
- ✗ You never entered a contest
- ✗ The website looks cheap/poorly made
- ✗ Asking for lots of personal info
- ✗ Poor spelling and grammar
- ✗ Address looks wrong

**What to do:** Close the browser tab immediately. Don't fill out any form. Tell an adult.

**Example 3: Fake Free Movie Website**

You search Google for "free movies online" and find a website called "MoviesFree.net".

The website has:
- Address: `http://moviefree.net` (no "https", no padlock)
- Lots of spelling mistakes
- Ads everywhere
- A big button saying "Click to Download FREE!"
- Asks you to enter your birthday

**Red flags:**
- ✗ No https or padlock
- ✗ Poor design and spelling
- ✗ Too many ads
- ✗ Asking for personal info
- ✗ Offering something for free that costs money

**What to do:** Leave the website. Don't click anything. Tell an adult.

**Example 4: Fake School Login**

You get an email that looks like it's from your school: "Click here to access your school portal. Enter your username and password."

You click the link. The website looks like your school's website, but:
- The address is `www.school-portal.net` (NOT your real school's address)
- There's no padlock icon
- The design looks slightly off

**Red flags:**
- ✗ Email asking you to click and log in
- ✗ Wrong address
- ✗ No padlock
- ✗ Design looks slightly wrong

**What to do:** Don't log in. Tell an adult. Your real school will never ask you to log in through an email.

**Example 5: Fake Download Button**

You're on a website and see a big button that says "DOWNLOAD" but it's NOT from the actual website.

For example, you want to download a video and there are THREE "Download" buttons on the page. One is from the real website (small, on the side). Two are FAKE (big, in the middle, in different colors).

**Red flags:**
- ✗ Multiple download buttons
- ✗ Buttons that look like ads
- ✗ Buttons in weird places

**What to do:** Use only the official download button. If you're not sure which one is real, ask an adult.

### How to Verify a Real Website

**Method 1: Check the Address**
1. Look at the address bar
2. Read it carefully — every letter
3. Make sure it matches the real website name
4. Look for the padlock icon

**Method 2: Use Google**
1. Close the website
2. Open Google
3. Search for the official website name
4. Click the first result from Google
5. Now you're on the real website

**Method 3: Ask an Adult**
If you're not sure if a website is real, ask a parent or trusted adult before clicking anything.

## Part 3: Protecting Your Personal Information

### What is Personal Information?

Personal information is anything that identifies you:
- Your real name
- Your address
- Your school
- Your phone number
- Your birthdate
- Photos of you
- Videos of you
- Your parents' information

### Information That's SAFE to Share

These things are okay to share online:

✓ Your hobbies and interests ("I like reading and science")
✓ Your opinions ("This movie was amazing!")
✓ Things you learned ("Today I learned about dinosaurs")
✓ Your favorite books, movies, or games
✓ Compliments and friendly comments
✓ Your thoughts on public topics

### Information That's DANGEROUS to Share

**NEVER share:**

| Information | Why It's Dangerous |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Your real name** | Someone could find your social media and learn more about you |
| **Your last name** | Combined with your first name, people can locate you |
| **Your school name** | Someone could find you in person |
| **Your address** | Burglars could rob your house; stalkers could find you |
| **Your phone number** | Scammers could call you or your parents; harassing calls |
| **Your birthdate** | Used for identity theft; predators use it to build trust |
| **Photos of you** | Could be used to catfish other kids; could be shared anywhere |
| **Your parents' names** | Scammers could impersonate them; stalkers could find them |
| **Your parents' phone number** | Scammers could call them |
| **Your passwords** | Someone could hack your accounts |
| **Your location** | Someone could find where you are right now |

### Real Examples of Information Being Misused

**Example 1: Name + School = Found in Person**

You comment on YouTube with your real name: "Great video! I go to Lincoln Elementary School!"

A stranger reads this. They:
- Search for your name online
- Find your school
- Find your Facebook or other social media
- Learn when you go to school
- Wait for you at the school gate

**How to prevent this:** Never share your school name online.

**Example 2: Address = Home Address Shared**

You fill out an online form with your address because a website promised a "free prize".

The website wasn't real. Your address is now:
- Sold to scammers
- Used to send mail scams
- Used by someone to find your house
- Used by thieves who know when you're home

**How to prevent this:** Never give your address to unknown websites.

**Example 3: Birthdate = Identity Theft Risk**

You share your birthdate online: "Just turned 11 today!"

A scammer now has:
- Your name
- Your birthdate
- Your school

They could:
- Pretend to be you
- Open fake accounts in your name
- Try to access your email
- Commit fraud using your identity

**How to prevent this:** Never share your birthdate online.

**Example 4: Photo = Used for Catfishing**

You send a selfie to someone you met online.

That person:
- Saves your photo
- Uses it to catfish OTHER kids
- Posts it on fake profiles
- Shares it without your permission

**How to prevent this:** Never send photos to people online, ever.

**Example 5: Location = Stalking Risk**

You post on YouTube: "Just got home from school!"

A person with bad intentions knows:
- Where you are (home)
- When you're home (right now)
- Maybe even your address

**How to prevent this:** Never share where you are in real time.

### Where Your Information Gets Shared

**YouTube Comments**
- Public to everyone on the internet
- Saved forever (even if you delete them)
- Can be screenshot or saved

**Example:**
You comment: "My name is Sarah and I go to Lincoln School"
✗ Now anyone on the internet knows this

**WhatsApp Messages**
- Saved on the person's phone
- Can be screenshot
- Can be shared with others
- Screenshot might include your number

**Example:**
You message someone: "Hi, I'm Sarah, I live on Oak Street"
✗ They can screenshot this and send it to anyone

**Website Forms**
- Information goes to the website owner
- Might be sold to scammers
- Might be hacked
- You have no control over it

**Example:**
You fill out: Name, Address, Phone Number, Email
✗ All this information is now in their database

**Location Services on Apps**
- Apps can track where you are
- Apps can share your location with others
- Your location history is recorded

**Example:**
You turn on location for a YouTube app
✗ The app knows where you are at all times

### How to Protect Your Personal Information

**Rule #1: Think Before You Share**

Before posting or commenting, ask yourself:
- Would I tell this information to a stranger?
- Could this information be used to hurt me?
- Could someone find me or my house with this?
- Could this information follow me forever?

If you answer YES to any of these, DON'T share it.

**Rule #2: Use Privacy Settings**

If you use YouTube or other websites:
- Keep your real name private
- Don't fill out personal information in profiles
- Don't share your location
- Don't friend/follow strangers

**Rule #3: Turn Off Location Services**

Location services let apps know where you are.
- Turn off location for apps you don't need it for
- Only turn it on for maps if you're lost
- Ask an adult how to do this

**Rule #4: Check Forms Before Submitting**

Before clicking "Submit" on any website form:
- ✓ Is this website real? (Check the address)
- ✓ Do I recognize this website?
- ✓ Does this website really need this information?
- ✓ Can I trust this website?

If you're not sure, ask an adult.

**Rule #5: Tell an Adult if You're Unsure**

When in doubt, ask a parent, guardian, or trusted adult:
- "Is this website real?"
- "Should I share this information?"
- "Does this seem like a scam?"

### Real Examples of Protecting Your Information

**Example 1: Safe YouTube Comment**

❌ Bad comment: "My name is Sarah and I live on Oak Street in Boston and go to Lincoln School"

✓ Good comment: "Great video! I learned a lot about dinosaurs!"

The good comment doesn't share any personal information.

**Example 2: Safe WhatsApp**

❌ Bad message: "Hi! My name is Sarah, I'm 11, I go to Lincoln School, and I live on Oak Street"

✓ Good message: "Hi! I saw your YouTube video and loved it!"

The good message doesn't share identifying information.

**Example 3: Suspicious Website Form**

A website asks: "Name, Address, Phone Number, Birthday"

You check:
- ✗ Address is wrong (not https)
- ✗ Website is unknown
- ✗ Why do they need my phone number?
- ✗ This seems like a scam

✓ You don't fill it out. You tell an adult.

**Example 4: Website You Recognize**

A real website you know asks: "Name and Address (for shipping)"

You check:
- ✓ Address is correct (https and padlock)
- ✓ This is a website you know
- ✓ They only need name and address (for shipping)
- ✓ You're buying something

✓ This is probably safe. You can share name and address.
