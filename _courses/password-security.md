## Why Passwords Matter

Your password is the key to your digital life. A weak or stolen password can give criminals access to your:
- **Bank accounts** - They can transfer money or make purchases
- **Email** - They can read your messages and reset passwords on other accounts
- **Social media** - They can impersonate you or scam your friends
- **Online shopping accounts** - They can make purchases with your saved cards
- **Medical records** - They can access sensitive health information

One weak password can be the entry point that unlocks everything. This course teaches you how to create strong passwords and manage them safely.

## What Makes a Password Weak?

### The Most Common Passwords (Never Use These!)

Every year, security researchers publish lists of the most commonly used passwords. Criminals try these first when attempting to break into accounts:

1. `123456`
2. `password`
3. `123456789`
4. `qwerty`
5. `abc123`
6. `password1`
7. `iloveyou`
8. `admin`
9. `welcome`
10. `monkey`

**If your password is on this list, change it immediately.**

### Why Short Passwords are Dangerous

The shorter a password, the easier it is for a computer to guess it automatically.

| Password Length | Time to Crack |
|---|---|
| 6 characters (letters only) | Less than 1 second |
| 8 characters (letters only) | 2 minutes |
| 8 characters (letters + numbers) | 1 hour |
| 10 characters (letters + numbers + symbols) | 5 years |
| 12 characters (mixed) | 3,000 years |

**Lesson: Longer passwords are dramatically more secure.**

### Other Common Password Mistakes

- **Using your name:** `john1960`, `mary2025`
- **Using birthdays:** `12031965`, `march1960`
- **Using family names:** `susansmith`, `jackandmary`
- **Using your address:** `42mainstreet`, `london2025`
- **Replacing letters with numbers:** `p4ssw0rd` (criminals know this trick!)
- **Using the same password everywhere** - If one site is hacked, all your accounts are at risk
- **Adding "1" or "!" to the end:** `password1`, `password!` (very predictable)

## What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password has all of these qualities:

### 1. Length - At Least 12 Characters

Longer is always better. Aim for 12-16 characters minimum.

### 2. Complexity - Mix of Character Types

Use a combination of:
- **Uppercase letters:** A B C D E
- **Lowercase letters:** a b c d e
- **Numbers:** 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
- **Symbols:** ! @ # $ % & * ( ) - _ + = ?

### 3. Randomness - Not Predictable

Avoid anything personal or sequential.

### 4. Unique - Different for Every Account

Never reuse passwords across different websites.

## How to Create a Strong Password

### Method 1: The Passphrase Method (Recommended for Beginners)

A passphrase is a string of random words joined together. It is long, easy to remember, and very hard to guess.

**Step 1:** Pick 4-5 random, unrelated words:
- Example: `purple elephant sunrise coffee`

**Step 2:** Capitalise the first letter of each word:
- `Purple Elephant Sunrise Coffee`

**Step 3:** Add numbers and symbols between the words:
- `Purple!Elephant7Sunrise#Coffee`

**Step 4:** Check your password:
- ✅ 30 characters long
- ✅ Has uppercase and lowercase
- ✅ Has numbers and symbols
- ✅ Easy to remember
- ✅ Extremely hard to crack

**More Passphrase Examples:**
- `Dog$Kitchen99Mountain!Lamp`
- `Blue@Chair&Running7Moon`
- `Quiet!Fish3Cloud#Happy`

### Method 2: The Sentence Method

Take a sentence you can remember and use the first letter of each word, mixed with numbers and symbols.

**Example sentence:** "My dog Bobby was born in March 1985 and loves cheese!"

**Password:** `MdBwbiM1985alc!`

**Breakdown:**
- M = My
- d = dog
- B = Bobby
- w = was
- b = born
- i = in
- M = March
- 1985 = the year
- a = and
- l = loves
- c = cheese
- ! = the exclamation mark

This creates a password that looks completely random but is easy for you to remember.

**More sentence examples:**
- "I moved to London in 2005 and I love it here!" → `ImtLi2005&Ilih!`
- "My first car was a red Ford in 1992" → `Mfcwar-Fi1992`

### Method 3: Random Password Generator

For maximum security, use a random password generator to create a completely random password.

**Where to find generators:**
- **Built into your browser** - Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox all offer to generate strong passwords when you create an account
- **Password manager apps** - 1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass all have built-in generators

**Example generated password:** `Kx9#mP2@vLq7!rNz`

This is extremely secure but harder to remember — which is why you should use a password manager (see below).

## Storing Passwords in Your Phone's Contacts — Why It Is Risky

Many people save their passwords inside their phone's Contacts app. A common trick is to create a fake contact entry — for example, a contact named "Bank" with the password saved as a phone number, or hidden in the Notes field of a contact. It feels clever and convenient, but it carries serious risks.

### Risk 1: Your Phone is the First Thing Thieves Target

If your phone is **stolen or lost**, the thief has immediate access to your Contacts app. They can:
- Browse all your contacts and spot anything suspicious like "Netflix password" or "Bank PIN"
- Even if you disguise it, a skilled thief knows exactly what to look for
- If your phone is not protected with a strong PIN or Face ID, they can get in instantly

### Risk 2: It Is Not Encrypted

The Contacts app is **not designed to store sensitive information**. Your contacts are:
- Backed up to the cloud in plain, readable form
- Accessible to any app you have granted Contacts permission to — including apps you may have forgotten about
- Visible to anyone who borrows your phone to "make a quick call"

A proper password manager encrypts everything with strong security. The Contacts app does not.

### Risk 3: It Syncs Everywhere — Including Places You Did Not Expect

Your contacts automatically sync to:
- iCloud or Google account
- Any computer where you are signed in
- Any new phone you ever set up with the same account

If any of those devices is lost, stolen, or accessed by someone else, your passwords are exposed.

### Risk 4: Accidental Sharing

People share contacts all the time without thinking:
- "Let me send you that number" — accidentally shares a contact with a password in the Notes field
- Backing up contacts and restoring to a family member's phone
- Giving your phone to a grandchild to look something up — they can scroll through Contacts

### Risk 5: No Password Change Tracking

When you change a password, it is easy to forget to update the contact entry — leaving you with outdated, confusing information and potentially locking yourself out.

---

### What to Do Instead

The good news: your phone already has a **free, built-in password manager** that is far safer and easier to use than the Contacts app.

- **iPhone/iPad:** Use **iCloud Keychain** — it stores passwords securely, fills them in automatically, and is protected by Face ID or your passcode
- **Android:** Use **Google Password Manager** — works the same way, built right into Chrome and your phone

These tools do everything the Contacts trick does, but safely, securely, and without the risks above. See the section below to learn how to use them.

## The Password Manager - Your Most Important Tool

Remembering a unique, strong password for every website is nearly impossible. A **password manager** solves this problem.

### What is a Password Manager?

A password manager is an app that:
- **Stores all your passwords** securely in one place
- **Remembers them for you** — you only need one master password
- **Automatically fills in** your username and password when you log in
- **Generates strong passwords** for new accounts
- **Works across all your devices** — computer, phone, tablet

### Built-In Password Managers (Free and Easy)

**On iPhone/iPad (iCloud Keychain):**
1. When you create an account on a website, your iPhone will offer to create a strong password
2. Tap "Use Strong Password"
3. Your iPhone saves it automatically
4. Next time you visit that site, it will automatically fill in your password
5. Your passwords sync across all your Apple devices

**On Android (Google Password Manager):**
1. When you create an account, Google Chrome will offer to save your password
2. Tap "Save"
3. Next time you visit, Chrome fills it in automatically
4. Sync across all your Android devices and Chrome browsers

**On Windows (Microsoft Edge):**
1. Edge offers to save passwords when you log in
2. Your passwords are stored in your Microsoft account
3. Sync across all Windows devices

### How to Use a Password Manager Day-to-Day

**When creating a new account:**
1. Your password manager offers to create a strong password
2. Accept the suggestion — you don't need to remember it
3. The password is saved automatically

**When logging into an existing account:**
1. Click on the username or password field
2. Your password manager fills it in automatically
3. Or look for your password manager's icon in the toolbar

**When you forget a password:**
1. Open your password manager app
2. Search for the website name
3. Find your saved password
4. Copy and paste it into the login box

### Tips for Using a Password Manager

- ✅ **Use a very strong master password** — This is the one password you must remember
- ✅ **Enable two-factor authentication** on your password manager account
- ✅ **Back up your passwords** — Export an encrypted backup periodically
- ❌ **Never share your master password** with anyone
- ❌ **Don't forget your master password** — Write it down and store it in a safe physical place

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) — Extra Protection

Even with a strong password, adding a second layer of protection is wise. This is called **Two-Factor Authentication** or **2FA**.

### What is 2FA?

When you log in, instead of just entering your password, you also confirm your identity a second way. Think of it like your bank card — you need both the card (something you have) AND your PIN (something you know).

### Types of 2FA

**1. Text Message (SMS) Code**
- After entering your password, a code is sent to your mobile phone
- You enter that code to complete the login
- Example: "Your verification code is 847291"
- ✅ Easy to set up
- ⚠️ Less secure than app-based 2FA (SMS can be intercepted)

**2. Authenticator App (Most Secure)**
- Download an app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator
- The app generates a new 6-digit code every 30 seconds
- You enter this code after your password
- ✅ More secure than SMS
- ✅ Works without mobile signal

**3. Email Code**
- A code is emailed to you after entering your password
- You enter that code to log in
- ✅ Simple to use
- ⚠️ Only as secure as your email account

### How to Set Up 2FA on Common Services

**Gmail/Google:**
1. Go to myaccount.google.com
2. Click "Security" in the left menu
3. Under "How you sign in to Google", click "2-Step Verification"
4. Follow the setup instructions

**Apple ID:**
1. Go to Settings on your iPhone
2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap "Sign-In & Security"
4. Tap "Two-Factor Authentication"
5. Follow the setup instructions

**Facebook:**
1. Go to Settings & Privacy → Settings
2. Click "Security and Login"
3. Find "Two-Factor Authentication"
4. Click "Edit" and follow the instructions

### Checking If Your Password Has Been Stolen

Data breaches happen when websites are hacked and passwords are stolen. You can check if your email address has been exposed:

1. Visit **haveibeenpwned.com** (a safe, reputable security website)
2. Type in your email address
3. It will tell you if your email appeared in any known data breach
4. If yes, change your passwords on affected sites immediately
